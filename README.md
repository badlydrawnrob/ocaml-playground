Ideally zip through the book and see if there's examples that can be mimicked with Elm. If it's like Haskell, with a lot of intracacies and quirks, it might not be worth getting through. I need to remind myself I'm not interested in learning programming at a deep level, I just want to build prototypes and small programs.

## My basic goal(s)

1. To be able to write good Elm code.
2. To be able to teach basic/intermediate programming.
3. To build a prototype with simple data.
4. To validate simple business models and make money.
5. To make enough money to make good art.
6. To potentially make code as art with a book.

## I'm not interested in:

- Re-learning recursion (unless it's simple stuff).
- Deep level knowledge like writing `.map` functions from scratch.
- Overly verbose and academic language that seems unecessary.
- Mathematical terminology or having to learn maths more than simple lambdas.
- To deal with low-level detail or database admin type stuff.



[^1]: You need to get back to How To Design Programs and simple lisp programs that might help you with a bit of Ai and everyday problems. Ideally you'll be using GUI tools for that kind of stuff however. I don't feel a "proper" programmer and have no real motivation to be; it takes far too long: "12 hours a day or you'll struggle".
